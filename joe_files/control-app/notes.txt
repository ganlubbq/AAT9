 TODOs:
--------

- check implemented functions on "ps3-controller.c"
- check IDs for the axis' of the controller
- test the integrated bluetooth receiver on the lego bricks
- check what happens when using the select / start (cause those are
  not analogs, so they only give 0 / 1.

 Additional notes:
-------------------
